# Etch-A-Sketch

An online replica of old drawing toy "Etch-A-Sketch". This version allows the user to select the size of the grid and, instead of leaving a black trail, it generates random colors which gradually become darker upon each pass with the cursor.

## Key Take-Aways/Challenges

DOM Manipulation 
- This project allowed me to practice manipulating the HTML using Javascript, with the help of event listeners, append(), and class lists. 

Grid
- Figuring out the logic behind how to create a user-generated grid took some time, but it taught me a lot about how to work with loops and functions.
